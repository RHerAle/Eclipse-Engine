  /* Where a point (px, py) of the fundamental plane meets the ellipsoid. The
     ellipsoid is mapped onto a unit sphere through the reduced latitude,
     which turns the intersection into one square root instead of an
     iteration.

     Six of the quantities this needs depend on the INSTANT and not on the
     point: the ellipsoid radius at the declination, that radius's sine and
     cosine, the declination's own sine and cosine, and the sidereal offset,
     which is a property of the elements. One drag of the time scrub solves
     both shadow cones at one instant and calls this **398 861 times a
     frame** -- counted, on 2026-08-12 at greatest eclipse. The umbra is a
     thousand of them; the rest is the penumbra, whose cone runs off the limb
     over most of its angles, and every gap there is subdivided to depth
     twelve. Rebuilding a square root, two cosines and a sine on each was a
     seventh of that gesture. They are worked out once per loop and handed
     down as plain numbers.

     Passed, not cached. A WeakMap keyed on the elements object was tried and
     is worse in three ways at once: it allocates an entry for every caller
     that projects a single point -- `axisPoint` does, thousands of times,
     sampling a central line -- it costs a hash lookup on every hit, and it
     needs a reference compare on every hit besides, because `dmu` belongs to
     the elements while the key is the instant. Get that compare wrong and an
     `e` from one elements set used with another gives a shadow outline
     displaced by the difference of two sidereal offsets, still shaped like a
     shadow outline. Handing the numbers down deletes the allocation, the
     lookup, the compare and the question together. */

  /* The form for a caller with one point to project: it works the six out
     and keeps no cache entry. A caller with a loop works them out once and
     calls `projectAt` directly.

     The miss is tested FIRST, before the sine, the cosine and the sidereal
     offset are paid for, because the miss is the common case and not the rare
     one: `centralLine` steps eight hours at six-second intervals and the
     shadow axis is off the Earth for four fifths of that window -- measured,
     205 863 of 268 856 axis samples across the catalogue. Computing all six
     as call arguments made those calls dearer than they were before any of
     this, on the one function this work was argued from.

     `q` here is the same expression on the same doubles as the one inside
     `projectAt`, so it returns null on exactly the same inputs -- checked
     against 59 290 of them, including both zeroes, the denormals, one unit in
     the last place either side of the limb, and a NaN declination.

     One thing does change: the reject returns before `dmuOf(B)` is
     evaluated, so a call with no elements at all now answers "the point
     missed the Earth" on four fifths of its calls instead of throwing. That
     is accepted rather than overlooked. No caller passes a bad `B`, and
     paying for the six on every miss to keep a TypeError is the wrong

  // The domain is framed with a row and a column of -1 one cell outside the

  // comes out cut at both edges, which is what a non-wrapping map has to show.
  // The outermost band starts at 5 %, not at 0.1 %.
  //
  // Not an aesthetic choice. Near the edge of the penumbra the eclipse lasts

  // 2001-instant sweep, the loss reaches 0.0165 of obscuration and 32 of 2227
  // fringe points with an eclipse read as zero. A 0.1 % contour chases a

  // three times the margin over that loss. What is left undrawn is some

  // already: it is the visibility contour, the dashed line.
