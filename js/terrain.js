 * Whether an eclipse can be seen from a place is not only a question of
 * geometry. Every other number on this page assumes sea level and an
 * astronomical horizon, and near sunrise or sunset that assumption is the
 * dominant error: a Sun at 3 degrees is behind the ridge, and the page used to
 * say it was up.
 *
 * So this module builds the real horizon: the elevation of the skyline as seen
 * from the marked point, azimuth by azimuth, from a public elevation model.
 * Two things fall out of it. The observer's own elevation, which the eclipse
 * geometry takes as a parameter and was being given as zero. And the terrain
 * horizon, which decides whether the Sun is actually in view at each contact.
 *
 * It runs in the browser. The only thing that leaves the machine is a request
 * for the elevation tiles that cover the area, which pins the visitor to a
 * tile some tens of kilometres across; nothing is computed anywhere else and
 * no coordinate is sent as a coordinate. That is still more than the rest of
 * this page does, which is why it happens on request and never on its own.
